        <h3>
            Battle For the Arena is a multiplayer strategy game created in Unity 3D. Development lasted about eight months and was done in a team of 5. 
        </h3>
        <p>
            In <i>Battle For the Arena</i>, players choose one of three heros to send to battle inside Lord Ares' gladiator arena.<br>
            For this project, I developed the arena generation system, and integrated networked multiplayer using the .NET Socket library.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Arena Generation System
        </h3>
        <p>
            The work I did on the generation system mostly involved porting <a href="JAFprocedural.html">JAFprocedural</a> to C#. The 
            <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy"> Strategy Pattern </a>was implemented to easily toggle different types of arena generation patterns. 
            Some additional generation functions and a new arena generation ruleset were added to the system in order to generate the Western Arena. <br>
            A basic tile property system was also developed. Tiles could be set as walkable, destructable, and even given an elevation.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Networked Multiplayer
        </h3>
        <p>
            The multiplayer implementation relied on a custom-built Gameplay Command System. Each turn would result in a Gameplay Command Block being pushed to the server, which would be distributed to the other player.<br />
            Any action performed by the player that would result in a state update would be called as a Gameplay Command. These included moving, attacking, or activating a special. The command would be automatically executed locally, 
            then added to a queue. <br>
            When the player finished their turn, each command in the queue would be parsed into bytes via marshalling, then sent to a byte array. Once the queue had been fully parsed into bytes, the array was sent to the server
            via TCP socket. The server would then send the commands to the other player client, which would marshal the received bytes into command objects, and perform the inverse exectution. <br>
            The server was set up to run on an AWS server during the GameCon showcase on April 6th, and clients were able to connect to the server remotely. <br>
            This was done entirely using the .NET Socket library, with no external packages or libraries used to aid in networking.
