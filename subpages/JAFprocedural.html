		<h1>
			JAFprocedural (Ongoing Development)
		</h1>

		<h3>
			JAFprocedural is a system designed to create 2D procedurally generated maps or layouts, which can be used in a variety of ways.
		</h3>
		<p>
			JAFprocedural is not a game, but rather a tool for development. I began working on it in the summer of 2022 after reading my old code from Season's Greetings and saying to myself "There has GOT to be a better way of doing all of this."
			The project ended up expanding far beyond that, and has evolved from "Season's Greetings room generation but more efficient" to "Dungeon Generator" to "Possibly a future Unity package". 
		</p>

		<h3>
			Current Features
		</h3>
		<p>
			-Stores maps in a custom object that uses a simple coordinate based access system<br>
			-Maps are divided into cells, which can be expanded to store more information<br>
			-Map sizes are defined by the user and the dimensions can be edited after generation<br>
			-Can generate maps from a user-defined seed, or completely randomly<br>
			-Uses combinations of several generation logic functions<br>
			-Can write a "generation script" in which the user decides which logic functions to use to generate maps with custom layout rules
		</p>

		<h3>
			Battle For the Arena-Exclusive Features
		</h3>
		<p>
			Some developer functionality was created during early development of Battle For the Arena. This includes:<br>
			-Map Saving/Loading system <br>
			-Ability to regenerate arena, and undo/redo generation actions <br>
			-Ability to toggle between different generation styles (Western vs Default) during runtime <br>
			These would all be excellent features to include in the main project, possibly in an editor mode. 
		</p>

		<h3>
			Future Plans
		</h3>
		<p>
			I think one of the current shortfalls of the system is that it greatly improves upon (and has some fairly decent new) generation 
			"rules" from Season's Greetings, but it falls short on implementing actual procedural algorithms. I would like to add some sort of noise algorithm to the 
			generation functionality, and think that adding Wave Function Collapse support would be interesting to implement and would work well in the spirit of the system. <br>
			I would also like to convert my C++ project into a DLL, so that I can combine the power of my C++ files with Unity's accessibility and UI implementation capabilities. 
			The Unity inspector would be a natural fit for controlling map generation, and converting the end result of this system into a Unity package would make it much more accessible and user-friendly.
