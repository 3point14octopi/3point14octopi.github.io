			  Hi, I'm 3Point14OctoPi. Welcome to my site

		<p> I like to make games. You can see some of them <a href="https://3point14octopi.itch.io/">here</a>. <br>
		I've also made some games with JAFBO, and those can be seen <a href="https://jafbo.itch.io/">here</a>.  </p>

            In true old internet style, this site is still under construction. I'm learning to use HTML again after several years and it's been a fun time so far.

			If you came here because of an old link to my portfolio, I've moved it to a different location on this site. Just ask for a new one and I'll send it your way 👍
