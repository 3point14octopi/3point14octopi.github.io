            WorseDiscord is a console-based chat client and server. I made it alone in February 2023. 
        </h3>
        <p>
            WorseDiscord is, as the tongue-in-cheek naming convention might suggest, a barebones text-based chat client and server. I developed it to practice using asynchronous
            TCP sockets and managing multiple clients in a server. <br>
            The client prompts the user to enter the IP address of the server, followed by a chat nickname. Other users who connect to the server will see messages displayed after 
            the nickname of the sender. <br>
            The server is able to handle voluntary (via the QUIT command) and involuntary client disconnections, and can safely remove their socket without disrupting the other 
            users connected to the server. <br>
            In terms of future development, I would definitely incorporate asynchronous client connections and would possibly expand the program to allow for multiple conversations
            to be held at the same time, on different threads (sort of like how some sites would have individual chat rooms). I would also consider expanding the command system 
            beyond QUIT, adding functionality such as the option to send a message only one user can see or the ability to change your nickname after joining the server.
